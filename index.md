I am a PhD student in Economics and Finance in the [Department of Economics](https://www.dse.univr.it/?lang=en) at the [Universit√† di Verona](https://www.univr.it/en/home). My research interests are Time Series Analysis, Financial Mathematics, and Climate Change and Financial Econometrics. Currently, I am finishing my mandatory first-year courses and slowly getting back to research.
